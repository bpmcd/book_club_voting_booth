# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

# b_one:
#   election: two
#   user: brian
# 
# b_two: 
#   election: one
#   user: bob
